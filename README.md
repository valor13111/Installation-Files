# Installation Files

## node.js
Step through the installation process, and with this you also get npm (node package manager).

To check if it worked:
  1.  Open command prompt, or some command line tool.
  2.  type **node -v**
  &nbsp;&nbsp;- This checks what version you have, and if you get a printout of the version, it was installed correctly
  3.  type **npm -v**
  &nbsp;&nbsp;- This checks what version of npm you have, if you get a printout, it was also installed correctly
  4.  Create a test file called helloworld.js
  5.  The only thing you need to type in the file is **console.log('It Installed!!!');**
    - To check out the file, and run it, open a command line tool, and navigate to the folder its located
    - Type **node helloworld.js**
    - This will run, and give a printout of **It Installed** in the command line
